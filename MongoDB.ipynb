    "Documents can contain nested arrays and subdocuments, making it well-suited for handling complex and semi-structured data.\n",

    "MongoDB is designed for horizontal scalability. You can distribute data across multiple servers or nodes using sharding to handle large data sets and high traffic loads.\n",
    "It supports automatic data partitioning and load balancing, making it suitable for scaling out.\n",
    "High Performance:\n",

    "MongoDB offers fast read and write operations due to its support for indexing and various query optimization techniques.\n",
    "It is well-suited for real-time applications and scenarios requiring low-latency data access.\n",
    "Rich Query Language:\n",
